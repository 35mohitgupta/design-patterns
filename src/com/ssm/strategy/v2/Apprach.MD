# Initial Approach

### We created different interfaces and implemented them when needed

## Advantages

1. Makes design more clean. A class needs to implement a feature only when needed.

## Disadvantages

1. Code Duplicacy
2. Maintenance issues may arise - if any implementation need to be changes all the implemented class needs to update their code
